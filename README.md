This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained "BERT" (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for text classification tasks. Specifically, the model is trained to classify news articles into different categories (e.g., technology, sports, business, science) using a dataset of news headlines.

Project Overview:
BERT is a transformer-based model developed by Google that revolutionized NLP tasks by capturing bidirectional context for better language understanding. In this project, we fine-tune BERT for document classification, leveraging the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Dataset:
The dataset consists of news articles categorized into multiple classes. Each article includes a headline and a brief description.
Train Dataset: Used to fine-tune the model.
Test Dataset: Used to evaluate the performance of the model.

How to Use:
1. Installation
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip`:
pip install torch transformers datasets
2. Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification:
Navigate to the `codes/fine-tuning/` folder and run the `fine_tune.py` script:
python fine_tune.py
This script fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model on your training data. The fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved in the `models/`folder.
3. Further Pre-training:
python pre_train.py
This script pre-trains BERT on your domain-specific corpus to better capture the language patterns of your domain.
4. Model Output:
Both the fine-tuned and further pre-trained models will be saved in the `models/` folder along with their tokenizers.
5. Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using your test dataset by modifying the `fine_tune.py` script to include an evaluation loop if required.

Training Configuration:
The fine-tuning script uses the following configuration:
- Learning Rate: `2e-5`
- Batch Size: `16`
- Epochs: `3`
- Optimizer: AdamW (default in Hugging Face's Trainer)
- Evaluation: Performs evaluation on the test set after training.
